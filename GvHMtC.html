				<h2>Matthew</h2>
				<div class="story">
					<p>
						Matthew started to lose his hair in 1999. To save his successful career as lead man in Hollywood's top RomComs he had to get a hair transplant.
					</p>

					<p>
						Things seemd to have gotten better for Matthew and he was able to go on to maketimeless classics such as <em>How to Lose a guy in 10 Days</em> and <em>The Ghosts of Girlfriends Past</em>. However in the summer of 2012 Matthew's hair began to get him alive. He lost 30lbs and the respect of the RomCom genre. Since his FGvH diagnosis Matthew's ilness has left him ostricized to role in boring erious dramas about history and science, such as <em>Dallas Buyer's Club, True Detective</em> and <em>Intersteller.</em>
					</p>

					<p>
						Matthew just wants to have fun again.

				<h2>Brendan</h2>
				<div class="story">
					<p>
						Brendan, just like Matthew was at the top of his career when he was diagnosied with FGvH. FGvH is a disease that gets worse over time. Being that Brendan has been living with FGvH for twice as long his career has been reduced to only to indie movies and animation voice overs. The last Hollywood role that he was casted in was an uncredited role in <em>G.I.Joe: The Rise of Cobra.</em> He is actually prohibited from being credited in any real movie now. 
					</p>

					<p>
						At this rate Brendan's career will be compleatly non exsistant in only a couple of years. Ever hopeful Brendan just wants to make it long enough to see <em>The Mummy 4</em> get made.
